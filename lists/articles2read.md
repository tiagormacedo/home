Black and Sanyal, _Underlying flag polymatroids_: http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12221

Tao, _Machine assisted proofs_: http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202501/rnoti-p6.pdf

    On computer-assisted mathematics: the instances in which machine learning, 
    proof assistants and large language models have advanced mathematics, and 
    the possibilities of combining these techniques in the future.


_Resolution of singularities via Tannaka duality_: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03205

Negut, _Category O for quantum loop algebras_: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00724

    We generalize the Hernandez-Jimbo category O of representations of Borel 
    subalgebras of quantum affine algebras to the case of quantum loop algebras 
    for arbitrary Kac-Moody g (as well as related algebras, such as quantum 
    toroidal gl(1)). Moreover, we give explicit realizations of all simple 
    modules, and devise tools for the computation of q-characters that are new 
    even for g of finite type. Our techniques allow us to generalize classic 
    results of FrenkelHernandez, Frenkel-Mukhin, Hernandez-Jimbo and Hernandez-
    -Leclerc, as well as prove conjectures of Feigin-Jimbo-Miwa-Mukhin and 
    Mukhin-Young.
