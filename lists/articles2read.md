_Resolution of singularities via Tannaka duality_: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03205

    Abstract. Resolving finite quotient singularities is a classical problem in
    algebraic geometry. Traditional methods of Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT)
    translate the singularity into a quiver representation space and take the 
    GIT quotient with respect to a generic stability parameter. While this 
    approach easily produces smooth resolutions, it fails to produce any stacky
    resolutions, as quiver representation spaces lack finite stabilizers. This
    paper provides an alternative framework which produces both smooth and stacky
    resolutions. Our framework is based on a trick of Abdelgadir and Segal, which
    deploys Tannaka duality to describe the points of the classifying stack of a
    finite group in terms of algebraic data. Abdelgadir and Segal successfully 
    pursue this strategy and obtain smooth and stacky resolutions in the Kleinian
    D4 case. We generalize this strategy to all Kleinian singularities and obtain
    a series of varieties which we refer to as Clebsch-Gordan varieties. We 
    provide tools to work with these Clebsch-Gordan varieties, analyze their 
    stable loci with respect to different stability parameters, and study the 
    Kleinian An and Dn cases in detail. 

Hernandez, Symmetries of Grothendieck rings in representation theory: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03024

    A broad overview on representation theory of Lie groups, Lie algebras, 
    monoidal categories, Grothendieck rings, and categorification.

Negut, _Category O for quantum loop algebras_: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00724

    Abstract. We generalize the Hernandez-Jimbo category O of representations
    of Borel subalgebras of quantum affine algebras to the case of quantum loop 
    algebras for arbitrary Kac-Moody g (as well as related algebras, such as  
    quantum toroidal gl(1)). Moreover, we give explicit realizations of all  
    simple modules, and devise tools for the computation of q-characters that 
    are new even for g of finite type. Our techniques allow us to generalize  
    classic results of FrenkelHernandez, Frenkel-Mukhin, Hernandez-Jimbo and 
    Hernandez-Leclerc, as well as prove conjectures of Feigin-Jimbo-Miwa-Mukhin 
    and Mukhin-Young.
