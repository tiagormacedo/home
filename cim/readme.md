# Communications in Mathematics technical editing

This page's main goal is to help the technical editors of the mathematical journal _Communications in Mathematics_ perform their work more efficiently.  The [webpage itself](http://tiagormacedo.github.io/cim) contains steps and instructions to be followed by these editors, and [the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KvmhIyxARafJm8qCPoxIfS2JgVLdP-ti) contains tools to help them perform these steps.
