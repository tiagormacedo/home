                <p>
                    The main goal of the technical editorial process is to fit all the articles that are published by Communications in Mathematics into the same standards.  To do that the technical editors will edit the source files sent by the authors and modify the parts that do not adhere to the standards of the journal.  More details about this process are contained in the steps below.
                </p>

                    <p> 
                        As soon as an article is accepted in the Episciences platform, ask the authors to send their manuscript using the journal's format ('Request for author's sources').

                        Here is a template email that you can use:
    
                        <blockquote style="background-color: white; font-family: Sans Serif, Open Serif, Arial; font-size: 11pt; padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px; margin: 25px 75px 25px 75px; line-height: 3ex;">

                            <br />
                            The template we use to publish articles in Communications in Mathematics can<br />
                            be downloaded from www.overleaf.com/read/hxycsnytwjcm.  Notice that there are<br />
                            4 files.  The only files that you will need to edit are commat.tex and<br />
                            commat.bib.  However, you will need to have all of these 4 files inside the<br />
                            same folder in order to successfully compile commat.tex.<br />
                            <br />
                            Please, send us the edited commat.tex and commat.bib files together with any<br />
                            other source file that may be necessary to successfully compile your article,<br />

                        Once you receive the manuscript in the format of the journal, make sure
                        that the authors have also responded through the Episciences platform.
                        (Otherwise, you will not be able to proceed with the editorial process.)

            </section>


            <section class="step" id="step1">

                <h3> Step 1: review the manuscript </h3>
                
                <p>
                    First, process the tex file sent by the author using the following form:
                </p>

                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <form action="https://tmacedo.pythonanywhere.com/cim/editex" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" target="invisible_iframe">
                        <label for="infile"> Upload tex: </label>
                        <input type="file" name="infile" required />
                        <input type="submit" value="process" class="button" onclick=displayLink() />
                    </form>

                    <iframe name="invisible_iframe" style="display: none;"></iframe>
                    
                    <p>
                        <span id="raw_outfile"></span>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        <span id="edited_outfile"></span>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Next, double-check the following: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spell and grammar.  My suggestion is that you use an online application, such as <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, <a href="https://linguix.com/">Linguix</a>, or Google Mail (paste the content of the paper into a new email and it should automatically check both spelling and grammar). 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If there are any sentences starting with a mathematical formula.  My suggestion is that
                        you search for <span class="latex">. $</span> in the tex file and rephrase those sentences.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If there are any mathematical formulas that break between two lines.  My suggestion is that
                        you: either use a display <span class="latex">\[ ... \]</span>, or reorder, or rephrase the sentence.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Avoid inline formulas longer than half of a line; use math display
                        <span class="latex">\[ ... \]</span> instead. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always use the enumerate and itemize environments for lists.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Instead of numbering equations or citing a reference by hand (using 
                        parenthesis or brackets), use <span class="latex">\cite</span>, <span class="latex">\ref</span> and <span class="latex">\eqref</span>.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Clear all the errors, warnings, overfull and underfull boxes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Step 3: make final edits </h3>

                <p>
                    When the authors and you agree with all the edition of their article, it is
                    time to do the final editing of their manuscript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, add the following lines right before <span class="latex">\begin{document}</span>:
                </p>

                <blocktex>
                    \VOLUME{&lt;volume number&gt;}<br />
                    \YEAR{&lt;volume year&gt;}<br />
                    \NUMBER{&lt;issue number&gt;}<br />
                    \firstpage{&lt; ask head technical editor &gt;}<br />
                    \DOI{https://doi.org/10.46298/cm.&lt;id of the paper&gt;}
                </blocktex>

                <img src="images/cim-paper_data.png"></img>

                <p>
                    Then, add the following line right before <span class="latex">\end{document}</span>:
                </p>

                <blocktex>
                    \EditInfo{&lt;received date&gt;}{&lt;acceptance date&gt;}{&lt;handling editor&gt;}

                <p>
                    Lastly, replace <span class="latex">\bibliography{commat}</span> in the tex file by the contents of the .bbl file that is created during compilation.  (This is important in order to avoid problems when ArXiv compiles the tex file.)

                    files that you used to compile the final version to the authors.
