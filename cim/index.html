                        Dear author, <br />
                        <br />
                        Thank you for your response.<br />
                        <br />
                        The template we use to publish articles in Communications in Mathematics can<br />
                        be downloaded from www.overleaf.com/read/hxycsnytwjcm.  Notice that there are<br />
                        4 files.  The only files that you will need to edit are commat.tex and<br />
                        commat.bib.  However, you will need to have all of these 4 files inside the<br />
                        same folder in order to successfully compile commat.tex.<br />
                        <br />
                        Please, send us the edited commat.tex and commat.bib files together with any<br />
                        other source file that may be necessary to successfully compile your article,<br />
                        as soon as possible.<br />
                        <br />

                <p> 
                    Once you receive the manuscript in the format of the journal, make sure
                    that the authors have also responded through the Episciences platform.
                    (Otherwise, you will not be able to proceed with the editorial process.)
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="step">

                <h3> Step 2: revision of the manuscript </h3>

                <p>
                    First, process the tex file sent by the author using the following form:
                </p>

                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <form action="https://tmacedo.pythonanywhere.com/cim/editex" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" target="invisible_iframe">
                        <label for="infile"> Upload tex: </label>
                        <input type="file" name="infile" required />
                        <input type="submit" value="process" class="button" onclick=displayLink() />
                    </form>

                    <iframe name="invisible_iframe" style="display: none;"></iframe>
                    
                    <p>
                        <span id="raw_outfile"></span>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        <span id="edited_outfile"></span>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Next, double-check the following: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spell and grammar.  My suggestion is that you copy the content of the 
                        paper, open Google Mail, create a new email, and paste the content of the
                        paper in the content are of the new email.  Google should automatically
                        check both spelling and grammar. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Sentences starting with a mathematical formula.  My suggestion is that
                        you search for <span class="latex">. $</span> in the tex file and rephrase those sentences.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Mathematical formulas that break between two lines.  My suggestion is that
                        you: either use a display <span class="latex">\[ ... \]</span>, or reorder, or rephrase the sentence.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Avoid inline formulas longer than half of a line; use math displays
                        <span class="latex">\[ ... \]</span> instead. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always use the enumerate and itemize environments for lists.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Instead of numbering equations or citing a reference by hand (using 
                        parenthesis or brackets), use <span class="latex">\cite</span>, <span class="latex">\ref</span> and <span class="latex">\eqref</span>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <div class="step">
                <h3> Step 3: send pdf to the authors </h3>

                    As soon as you are done reviewing the authors' manuscript send it back to
                    the authors, asking if there are any further changes that they would like

                <h3> Step 4: final edits </h3>

                <p>
                    When the authors and you agree with all the edition of their article, it is
                    time to do the final editing of their manuscript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, add the following lines right before <span class="latex">\begin{document}</span>:
                </p>

                <blocktex>
                    \VOLUME{&lt;volume number&gt;}<br />
                    \YEAR{&lt;volume year&gt;}<br />
                    \NUMBER{&lt;issue number&gt;}<br />
                    \firstpage{&lt;first page of the paper: odd&gt;}<br />
                    \DOI{https://doi.org/10.46298/cm.&lt;id of the paper&gt;}
                </blocktex>

                <img src="images/cim-paper_data.png"></img>

                <p>
                    Then, add the following line right before <span class="latex">\end{document}</span>:
                </p>

                <blocktex>
                    \EditInfo{&lt;received date&gt;}{&lt;acceptance date&gt;}{&lt;handling editor&gt;}
                </blocktex>

                <img src="images/cim-paper_data2.png"></img>
                
                <p>
                    Lastly, replace <span class="latex">\bibliography{commat}</span> in the tex file by the contents of the .bbl file that is created during compilation <span class="latex">\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}</span>.  (This is important in order to avoid problems when ArXiv compiles the tex file.)

                    Once you have finished editing the authors' manuscript, send the source
                    files that you used to compile the final version to the authors.
