    <p> 
        As soon as an author sends their manuscript, verify if the manuscript is
        in the format of the journal. 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> 
            If it is not, then ask the author to edit their manuscript using the 
            format of the journal.  Here is a template email that you can use:
            <blockquote>
                Dear author,

                Thank you for your response.

                The template we use to publish articles in Communications in Mathematics is 
                attached.  Notice that there are 3 files.  The only file you will need to
                edit is commat.tex.  However, you will need to have all of these 3 files
                inside the same folder in order to successfully compile file commat.tex.

                Please, send us the edited commat.tex file together with any other source 
                file that is necessary to successfully compile your article as soon as 
                possible.

                Best regards,

                <your name>
                Technical editor of Communication in Mathematics

            Remeber to attach: commat.tex, commat.cls and episciences.png.
        </li>

        <li> 
            If the manuscript is in the format of the journal, proceed with its 
            revision (Step 2).

<h3 style="font-weight: bold"> Step 2 </h3>

    <p>
        Revision of the paper.  Make sure to check the following: 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Spell and grammar.  My suggestion if that you copy the content of the 
            paper, open Google Mail, create a new email and paste the content of the
            paper.  Google checks both spell and grammar. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Sentences starting with a mathematical formula.  My suggestion is that
            you search for <i>". $"</i> in the content of the paper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Avoid inline formulas longer than half of a line. Use math displays
            <i>\[...\]</i> instead. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Always use the enumerate and itemize environments for lists.
        </li>

        <li>
            Always use \dots, \ldots, \dotsc, \cdot, etc, instead of "..." or ".".
            My suggestion is that you search for <i>"..."</i> in the content of the 
            paper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Instead of numbering equations or citing a reference by hand (using 
            parenthesis or brackets), always use \cite, \ref and \eqref.
        </li>

        <li>
            Delete all horizontal or vertical spacing, such as \hskip, \vskip, 
            \smallskip, \medskip, \bigskip, \\, \newpage and \clearpage.
        </li>

        <li>
            The references contain: authors' names, title, no empty fields (such as
            empty parenthesis), the page numbers are not followed by a dash (replace
            "--" by "-" between the pages' numbers).
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the following lines right before <i>"\begin{paper}"</i>:
            <blockquote>
                \VOLUME{<volume number>}
                \YEAR{<volume year>}
                \NUMBER{<issue number>}
                \firstpage{<first page of the paper: odd>}
                \DOI{https://doi.org/10.????/cm.<id of the paper>}
            </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the following line right before <i>"\end{paper}"</i>:
            <blockquote>
                \EditInfo{<received date>}{<acceptance date>}{<handling editor>}
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
        As soon as you are done reviewing the author's manuscript send it back
        to the author (Step 3).

<h3 style="font-weight: bold"> Step 3 </h3>

    <p> 
        As soon as you are done reviewing the author's manuscript send it back to
        the author, asking if there is any further changes they would like you to
        make.  Here is a template email that you can use:

            Dear author,

            Thank you for sending your manuscript.

            I am attaching to this email an updated version of your it.  If there is

<h3 style="font-weight: bold"> Step 4 </h3>

    <p>
        When the author and you agree with all the edition of their article, send 
        the source files that you used to compile the final version of their 
        article to them.  Here is a template email that you can use:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Dear author,

        Thank you for your response.

        In that case, I would like to ask you to *update* your posting on ArXiv/HAL 
        to its final version (see attached files).  Please, do not make a new 
        posting, as EpiSciences uses the id of the posting in the open repository 
        that was informed during submission.

        As soon as your article is updated, please, let me know.

        Best regards,

        <your name>
        Technical editor of Communications in Mathematics
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Make sure you attach the tex file of the final version, together with:
        commat.cls, episciences.png and any other file (figures, etc) that the 
        author may need to successifully compile the tex file.
    </p>


<h3 style="font-weight: bold"> Step 5 </h3>

    <p>
        As soon as the author updates their posting on the open repository (ArXiv or
        HAL), check on the Episciences platform if there is a new version available
        and publish the paper:

<h3> General suggestions </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Be kind and patient.
        </li>

        <li>
            Try to perform all the steps within 24hs.  In the beginning, Step 2 may take
            a little longer.  But it gets easier and faster with time.
        </li>

        <li>
            Never change the file commat.cls.
        </li>

        <li>
            Do not ask the authors to perform more than one action in the same email.
        </li>
